If you don't know what a bitcoin clipper is, let me explain. Basically, when this bitcoin clipper is installed on your computer, everytime you copy/paste a bitcoin address, it will change into that hacker's bitcoin address, and you might send the money to the hacker instead of the person you actually wanted to send to. And since many people don't check their addresses after sending, this clipper is very easy for hackers to use, very effective for them, and very disastrous for those who fall for it. Also much less likely to be detected by AV than RATs or keyloggers.

-100% c++

-startup

-fake messagebox

-mutex

-icon changer

-ethereum case matching (if your address is in all uppercase and the victims copied address is in lowercase, it changes ur address to lowercase too, this works because ethereum addresses arent case sensitive).
